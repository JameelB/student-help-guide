# Buddy Guide
As part of Red Hat's internship programme, each new hire will be allocated a buddy. A buddy is an experienced team member who will be able to provide training, instruction and leadership for the student. This is a guide for what is expected of you as a buddy to ensure that the student have a pleasant experience during their internship.


# Before the new student starts
- Ensure you are familiar with the student you are paired up with. Read their CV, learn something about them. 
- Ensure that any materials that the student needs are available and ready (i.e. laptop, account details, access badge, etc.)
- Ensure that you are familiar with the [internship programme schedule](https://github.com/feedhenry/student-help-guide/blob/master/programme-schedule.md)
